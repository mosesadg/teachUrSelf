Mongodb

Followed an online tutorial to implement MongoDB on an express app.

Why did you choose this subject?
Wanted to learn about a NoSql database.

How were you first made aware of it?
Mongo is mentioned along with Express and the MEAN stack.

What problem does it solve? How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?Why does one use it?
Helps store object oriented data in a collection of objects/documents instead of in flat two dimensional tables.


What are the alternatives?
Cassandra
CouchDB

What is it similar to, if anything?
Similar to JSON like documents.

What is the history of this technology?
First released in 2009

Who built it and why?
First developed by the software company MongoDB Inc as a component of a planned platform as a service product.

Who is maintaining it?
The company shifted to an open source development model in 2009, with MongoDB offering commercial support and other services

What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
I folowed a tutorial and found it easy to implement. I used this on just one model. Will need to see how this works as a project gets bigger.

What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
There were several tutorials that explanined the whole MEAN stack but only a few for just Mongo. Got one that used Monk instead of Mongoose.

What resources do you recommend for interested students? What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
I used this tutorial:
